# time_for_tea
An example end-to-end ML classification project

Uses the template for building an ML project in the book Hands on ML by Aurelien Gueron.

Applies this to the problem of predicting whether a kettle has been switched on, given total household electricity usage, using a variety of ML classification approaches.

# Usage
To interact with the project start with the jupyter notebooks in '/interactive':
- model_ml_project_part1_chose_data.ipynb
- model_ml_project_part2_design_and_build.ipynb

You will need to download the REFIT data using the link in the part1 notebook above in order to run them.

Some exploratory analysis is included in '/interactive/exploratory'

# Requirements
See requirements.txt for a list of packages required
